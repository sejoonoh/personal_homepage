* I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). [[Curriculum Vitae]](https://github.com/sejoonoh/sejoonoh.github.io/blob/master/files/CV_Sejoon_Oh_2019.pdf).
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Seoul National University](http://snu.ac.kr). My undergraduate research advisor was [Prof. U Kang](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang/), and I was a research intern in [SNU Data Mining LAB](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/) for 2 years.
* My research interests include data mining and knowledge discovery, machine learning, parallel and high-performance computing, and recommender system.


# What's New?

* (Sep. 2019) A paper '[Fast, Accurate and Provable Triangle Counting in Fully Dynamic Graph Streams](http://dmlab.kaist.ac.kr/~kijungs/papers/thinkdTKDD2020.pdf) is accepted to **TKDD Journal**.

* (Aug. 2019) I receive `[Kwanjeong Educational Foundation Fellowship](http://en.ikef.or.kr/)', one of the **most prestigious fellowships** in Korea, which supports up to 30K USD per year!

* (May~Aug. 2019) I totally enjoyed my summer research internship @ [WATCHA, Inc.](https://team.watcha.com/) (project: personalized recommender system with tensor factorization and deep neural network).
