* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computational Biology Department](https://cbd.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). [[Curriculum Vitae]](https://github.com/sejoonoh/sejoonoh.github.io/blob/master/files/CV_Sejoon_Oh_2019.pdf).
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Seoul National University](http://snu.ac.kr). My undergraduate research advisor was [Prof. U Kang](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang/), and I was a research intern in [SNU Data Mining LAB](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/) for 2 years.
* My research interests include data mining and knowledge discovery, machine learning, parallel and high-performance computing, and computational biology.
