* I am a CS Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~srijan/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). [[Curriculum Vitae]](https://github.com/sejoonoh/sejoonoh.github.io/blob/master/files/CV_SejoonOh_Jan2020.pdf).
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Seoul National University](http://snu.ac.kr) (Advisor: [Prof. U Kang](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang/)), and I was a research intern in [SNU Data Mining LAB](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/) for 2 years.
* My research interests include machine learning and deep learning, parallel and high-performance computing, and recommender system.


# What's New?
